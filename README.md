### Description

FragIt is now more enhanced and more reliable. Including safe data handling and in this release the fraging (splitting) limit is broken, means you can now break a file into unlimited fragments. You can control the fragment file number with the fragment size only and nothing else. Don't lose focus on the new on-the-fly canceling option. Now for the unlimited fraging capability you might end up fraging your 2MB file into 2097152 fragments and it really takes a while. When you hit the Initialize button it changes into cancel button. So using this new cancel option you can cancel both split and merge actions on-the-fly and there is no data lose! Cool Hah?

It would be nice if you VOTE for me. There is a lot of hard work involved in this project.
