<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Q.</b> What is FragIt?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A.</b> FragIt is such a program 
that can split a file in several fragment and merge those fragments to form the 
original file.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Q.</b> Why did you made it?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A.</b> Actually it was a 
request from one of my friends. Anyway, transferring data from one PC to another 
by floppy disk is a very popular method. But for less data capacity, files 
larger then 1.38 MB cannot be transferred with it. So I developed this program 
to split a large file into fragments that can fit in a floppy disk and after 
transferring all the fragment files this program has the capability to merge 
those files to form the original one. This program was also made for those who 
have slow internet connection so they can upload files in fragments.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Q.</b> This program does a 
lot and with a very graphical interface, so how did you managed to keep the exe 
size less then 70kb? </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A.</b> That wasn't so hard. 
At first when I developed this program for test believe it or not it was only 
30kb long. Than started to work with the interface and added some graphics for 
the tab and the control-box and also added some simple VB controls. This boosted 
the file size to 60kb. Than I thought to add some more options and some 
enhancements to the interface. Its like an illusion, it uses simple few lines of 
code to give an impression of heavy use of graphic. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Q.</b> Is there any data 
loss in the file split and merge process?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A.</b> No, there is no data 
loss in the process and it's safe.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Q.</b> I want to split a 
file that is quite large and important, so it'll take some time to do it. If the 
program is accidentally shut down, would there be any data lose? </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A.</b> No, this program 
works only with the destination file. It does no harm to the source file. And if 
you select any of the deleting option the program will not delete the source 
file. The program always deletes files after it's done all of its works. (This 
is what makes the program safe and robust.)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Q.</b> To browse a file can 
take a while, is there any other way to select a file faster?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A.</b> Yes, the program 
supports both browse and drag-and-drop option. The drag-and-drop option lets you 
drag a file from the desktop directly to the text fields. This saves a lot of 
time.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Q.</b> If I change the 
fragment file name, would the program be able to merge the files?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A.</b> No (or maybe yes, IF 
you know exactly what you are doing), it is highly 
recommended you don’t change the fragment file name until you merge them 
together. This can cause you a lot of 
trouble.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Q.</b> Why is the interface 
of the program so small?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A.</b> I don’t like utility 
programs take a lot of space on screen and personally I like compressed 
interface. But I did all I can to make this program’s interface understandable.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Q.</b> I am trying to split 
a file but I can’t. I gave it a valid file name, fragment size but it is showing 
an error message. What should I do?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A.</b> The problem is 
common. This program doesn’t support file overwriting. So if you are attempting 
to split a file more then once in the same directory. You may face this problem. 
Try deleting previously created fragment files. New in this release, there is 
two new options located in the split and merge tab which allows you to delete 
original file or the fragment files after splitting or merging. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Q.</b> I am having problem 
merging files although I have all the fragment files in the same directory and 
selected a valid fragment file. What do I do now?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A.</b> As told before this 
program doesn’t support file overwriting. If you are trying to merge more then 
once then you might have end up merging into the same file. Try deleting the 
previously created file or just use that file.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Q.</b> What's new in this 
release of FragIt without the file deleting option and the new gradient 
interface?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A.</b> From the outside it 
seems to have no change inside but there is. In this release the fraging 
(splitting) limit is broken, means you can now break a file into unlimited 
fragments. You can control the fragment file number with the fragment size only 
and nothing else. Don't lose focus on the new on-the-fly canceling option. Now 
for the unlimited fraging capability you might end up fraging your 2MB file into 2097152 fragments and it really takes a while. When you hit the Initialize 
button it changes into cancel button. So using this new cancel option you can 
cancel both split and merge actions on-the-fly and there is no data lose.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Q.</b> How may I contact 
with you if I need to?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A.</b> You can email me at
<a href="mailto:lifeforcez@hotmail.com" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
lifeforcez@hotmail.com</a> asking any question about this program. I’ll be glad 
to help you. </font></p>
